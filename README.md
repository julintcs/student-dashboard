Make sure you have yarn and MongoDB installed.

First go to the root directory in the command line and type

`yarn`

It will install all the packages required (as specified in `package.json`). Takes some time.

Start MongoDB server with the `mongod` command and after it starts, run

`yarn start` from the root directory to run the server for development purposes.

Go to `http://localhost:3030/` to view the site.
